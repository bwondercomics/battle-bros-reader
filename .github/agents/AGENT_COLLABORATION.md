- Feature prioritization

## Example Collaborations

### Example 1: Adding Panel Zoom Feature

**ComicBot**: "Let's add a magnifying glass feature where users can hover over panels to see details without leaving the page flow."

**TechAdvisor**: "Interesting idea! A few technical considerations:
1. Should we use CSS `transform: scale()` or Canvas rendering?
2. How do we handle touch devices (no hover state)?
3. What's the memory impact of loading high-res versions?
4. Performance on older devices?

I suggest:
- Use CSS transforms for better performance
- On touch: double-tap to zoom into a panel
- Lazy load high-res images only when needed
- Add a performance budget threshold"

**ComicBot**: "Good points! For touch, let's use a pinch gesture instead of double-tap - more intuitive. And we can show a zoom indicator on mobile."

**TechAdvisor**: "Perfect! Pinch is better. I'll implement using the PointerEvent API for unified touch/mouse handling. We can add a subtle animation to indicate zoomability."

**Result**: Both agents contributed their expertise to create a well-designed, technically sound feature.

### Example 2: Slow Page Load Times

**User Report**: "Pages take too long to load on mobile"

**TechAdvisor**: "Let me analyze the performance metrics:
- Current LCP: 3.2s (needs improvement)
- Image sizes averaging 2MB each
- No preloading strategy
- Sequential loading causing waterfall

Recommendations:
1. Convert images to WebP/AVIF format
2. Implement aggressive preloading (next 3-5 pages)
3. Add loading skeletons
4. Consider Service Worker caching"

**ComicBot**: "The loading skeletons are crucial for perceived performance. Let's design them to match the comic aesthetic - maybe with a scanline effect? And we should show a progress indicator so readers know content is coming."

**TechAdvisor**: "Love the scanline idea! For the progress indicator, I can expose the preload progress via an event. We could show it in the existing progress bar at the bottom."

**ComicBot**: "Perfect! Let's make the skeleton animate with our existing glitch effect - keeps the retro aesthetic consistent."

**Result**: Technical performance improvements enhanced with thoughtful UX design.

### Example 3: Accessibility Concerns

**TechAdvisor**: "Our current implementation has accessibility issues:
- No keyboard navigation for panels
- Missing ARIA labels on controls
- Insufficient color contrast in some UI elements
- Screen readers can't navigate the comic properly

We need to address WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance."

**ComicBot**: "You're absolutely right. Let's redesign the navigation with accessibility first:
- Add keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, space, etc.)
- Create a comic panel description system
- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable
- Add skip navigation links

For the visual design, we can maintain the neon aesthetic while ensuring 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Maybe increase the primary color brightness slightly?"

**TechAdvisor**: "Great plan! I'll implement:
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA live regions for page updates
- Focus management for modal controls
- Keyboard trap prevention in fullscreen mode

I'll use the Chrome DevTools accessibility audit to validate everything."

**ComicBot**: "And I'll create an 'Accessibility Mode' option that users can toggle - increases contrast, simplifies animations, adds more visual feedback."

**Result**: Comprehensive accessibility improvements that enhance the experience for all users.

## Communication Tips

### For Users Working with Both Agents

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with ComicBot for feature ideas and UX vision
2. **Get Technical**: Bring in TechAdvisor for implementation planning
3. **Iterate**: Let them challenge each other's ideas - it leads to better solutions
4. **Ask for Debate**: Specifically request both agents to discuss trade-offs
5. **Be Specific**: When you know what you want, specify which agent to use

### Sample Prompts

**For Collaborative Work**:
- "ComicBot and TechAdvisor: Discuss the best approach for adding bookmark functionality"
- "I need both UX and technical perspectives on improving page transition speed"

**For ComicBot**:
- "ComicBot: Design a new reading mode for mobile devices"
- "How can we make the comic reader more engaging for new users?"

**For TechAdvisor**:
- "TechAdvisor: Review the zoom functionality for performance issues"
- "What's the best way to implement offline reading capability?"

## Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Complementary Skills
- ComicBot excels at "what" and "why" (features and user value)
- TechAdvisor excels at "how" and "what if" (implementation and edge cases)

### 2. Encourage Healthy Debate
- Let the agents challenge each other
- Different perspectives lead to better solutions
- Final decisions should balance UX and technical reality

### 3. Know When to Choose One
- Small CSS tweaks? → ComicBot
- Security patches? → TechAdvisor
